Please place the file cleanedproject.py, the training csv file (data_7000_new.csv) and the 
testing csv file (data1.csv) into the same folder. 

Run the program to see the outputs of Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression classifier.

=======DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT=======

Memotion (Meme + Emotion) Analysis is the task of analyzing sentiments from memes, typically posted in various social platforms, and classifying them into positive and negative sentiments. We present a methodology that represents our utilized approach to extract and analyze embedded texts of a meme from a released data set (training and trial) of a SemEval-2020 task titled as ”Memotion Analysis”. We utilize a Naive Bayes classifier to classify our texts into sentiments, and logistic regression classifier is used as a baseline approach to compare the results of the classification. We have measured F1 score for both the approach and have obtained a score of 93.00% and 90.86% for the Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression classifier respectively.
